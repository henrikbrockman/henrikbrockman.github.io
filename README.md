# Henrik Brockman

I like electrical and mechanical engineering and their intersection. I am a student at UCLA in the Electrical Engineering B.S. major with a tech breadth in mechanical engineering. I have two years of hands-on experience with Bruin Racing, currently as a suspension testing and analysis engineer. I also have experience with C++, Python, Arduino, circuits, SolidWorks, Onshape, and manufacturing like 3D printing and milling.

Engineering Fields I have an interest in:
- Automotive
- Robotics
- Audio
- Cycling
- Consumer Product Design

## Experience
#### Suspension Testing and Analysis Engineer
- Bruin Racing Baja Team

---
## Projects

##### Torsion Sensor for Anti-Roll Bar
- I worked on a team of two to design and implement a torsion measurement device for our Baja-SAE 2025 car.
- Skills used:
	- CAD
	- Physics Calculations
	- Manufacturing
	- Electronics

##### Shock Travel Sensing System
- I worked with the same team to measure shock travel for the same car.
- Skills used:
	- CAD
	- Manufacturing
	- Electronics
	- Data Analysis

##### Audio communication system
- I worked one other person to design a rudimentary audio transmission device using encoding in light. We used Python libraries to downsample an audio file for transmission through a voltage-controlled light source and corresponding sensor.
- Skills used:
	- Python
	- Arduino
	- C++
	- Circuit Theory
	- Data Analysis
